### List 2

- Located under `code/julia/list-2/` 

- ex 3,4:

 - It seems that the average of the rating of one ITEM over all users that rated it performs slightly better (i.e. is a slightly better predictor for the actual rating) than the average of the rating of one USER over all items he/she rated:

 - 5 runs of `ex3.jl` (using user average) averaged **0.833** error.
 - 5 runs of `ex4.jl` (using item average) averaged **0.813** error.

- ex 5

 - For exercise 5, I've experimented using *both* the average rating by the user *and* the average rating given for the item  when predicting a rating given by a user for an item. Each "guess" was given equal weight

 - 5 runs of `ex5.jl` averaged **0.795** error

### Item-based K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm

- Located under `code/python/item-based-knn/`

 > Based upon [Andre Ng's CS 229 notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2008/Wen-RecommendationSystemBasedOnCollaborativeFiltering.pdf)

`item-based-knn.py` is a na√Øve implementation of the k-nearest neighbours algorithm applied for recommending items.

The general idea is to find items that are similar to a movie *m* so that we can determine what rating a user *u* would give for movie *m*, given that user *u* has not yet seen movie *m*. I have used the **adjusted cosine similarity** between movies a and b.

Sample results can be found in file `results.csv`, which is of the form: 

    USER_ID,ITEM_ID,ORIGINAL_RATING,PREDICTED_RATING,ROOT_SQUARED_ERROR

### SVD Algorithm

- Located under `code/python/svd/`

This algorithm tries to decompose and discover a *low-dimensional* approximation of the **user-movie** matrix (**A**), where each row represents a user and each column represents a movie, and element **Aij** represents the *rating* user *i* gave to movie *j*.

Each user *u* and movie *m* have a **feature vector**, modelled in the same feature-space. Unknown ratings can be inferred by performing the dot product between the feature vectors for user *u* and movie *m*.

### Adding Temporal Features to COFILS method

Add temporal features to the method created by [Braida et al. (2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741500038X). The COFILS method basically transforms a preference matrix (users X items) into a dataset that can be used for regular supervised learning, using matrix factorization techniques such as SVD (Singular-value decomposition).

We experiment with several ways of adding temporal features to the dataset obtained from the previous step, and explain results obtained after applying each strategy.
